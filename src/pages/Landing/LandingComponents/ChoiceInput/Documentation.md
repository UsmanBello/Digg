The choice input is the component to display the Input selected by the user.

It takes in the following props (name,id, value, handleChange, formDataValue, type, imgSrc)

name- The name selector of the input
value- The value to select
handleChange- controls the element 
formDataValue- Selected value,
type- The Choice input can either be a RADIO input or a CHECKBOX input(In this application, it should be used in the Select interests Options, since more than one option can be selected. However, I assumed it was a radio button for breviety and as shown in the mockup)
imgSrc- Contains the image source so that it will display the Icon
