DIGGS ONBOARDING

#Running the program
Run the application by the command "npm start"

#Folder structure
Components folder contains components shared by the whole app. 

pages folder contains all the routes / pages, in this application, I have created one page which contain 9 screens(OnBoarding screens)


Each page contains its component, i.e components that are exclusively for the page, in my case Landing page contains LandingComponents,
this is where the OnBoarding screen exist.

Assets folder contains images which are the icons used in this application. Ideally, the Icons should be gotten from a CDN. 

utils folder contains the helper and formValidation files
-The formValidation file contains helper functions for formValidation
-The helper file contains all the data used in the application
